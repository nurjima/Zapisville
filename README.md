## Case:
- Create an internal mini-game given the context of the Zapis mobile app to gamify the user experience.
- The application must have a user progression system.
- Provide elements and mechanics of involvement.
- It will be great if users can interact with each other.

## Requirements:
- The prototype must be made entirely at the hackathon and is not a development of an existing product.
- The prototype must be workable, functional and with an original design.
- Platforms for which the prototype should be developed: Mobile-priority, Web-mobile first.
- You can use any libraries and frameworks.

## Solution:
Interactive game with user interaction with their virtual character. The main task of the user is to maintain daily progress in passing mini-games to receive rewards and bonuses. The character interacts with the user through push notifications and random requests.
